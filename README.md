# Leaderboard 

- Developing a task using Node.js for the backend, MySQL as the database, and React for the frontend user interface. 

Reauirements : 

- Display a leaderboard sorted by points, with users who have the most points listed first. Each user should be displayed with their ID, full name, total points, and rank.
-  The leaderboard should be filterable by:
    - Day (displays results for today only)
    - Month (displays results for the current month)
    - Year (displays results for the current year)
- Search: A search bar should allow input of a user ID, displaying the corresponding userâ€™s details as the first entry on the leaderboard. (When a user searches by User ID and that ID is not found in the database, an error message should be displayed using a toast notification on the UI)

- Re-calculate: When new dummy data is inserted and the "recalculate" button is clicked, the leaderboard should update accordingly.

- The SQL database files have been created and are added to the Git repository for version control and easy setup.
